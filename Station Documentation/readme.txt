This folder will be used to store station documentation.  Subfolders to be created as appropriate, but at a high level this directory tree will include things like:

     * Equipment Reference i.e. Manuals for equipment in the station
     * Descriptions of equipment both radio and non-radio
          - i.e. Radios, accessories, Computer models in use, specs, OS, micro-controllers, audio equipment, etc.
     * Documentation required to be maintained in-shack (i.e. copy of Part 97 etc.)
     * Required RF exposure calculations

Documentation here is limited to the equipment "in shack" in its current state.  Documentation for equipment to be added shouldn't appear until equipment is in-place.
