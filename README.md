Primary Objectives:
  - Share current state design, documentation, hardware, and interconnections
  - Share future state design, documentation, hardware, and interconnections
  - Accept input via pull requests for changes to current state and future state designs
  - Encorage Collaboration on software to use in-shack
  - Encourage Collaboration on custom software used to control shack functions
  - Encourage Collaboration on hardware to use in-shack
  - Encourage Collaboaration on customer hardward used to control shack functions

This repository (N3VEM/OpenShack) will serve as the repository for non-software design and documentation.
Related repositories (N3VEM/OpenShack-XXXX) will be created as needed for specific software packages, either individually, or in groups, as required, to make it easier to sync different repositories to different locations and different peices of equipment as needed.

N3VEM/OpenShack : This Repository
N3VEM/OpenShack-AutomationWeb : Repository for html/php code for UI, python scripts for sensor data to be displayed in that interface, etc.
